<h1 class='caption'>How to overcome our shortcomings</h1 >
<p class='caption'>First of all, we should have self-knowledge and know our shortcomings, then we can have a way to solve our shortcomings and strive to overcome them.

The second is that we are aware of our shortcomings. We should be good at controlling other people's words about our problems. In short, we should control our emotions and don't let other people's words disturb our progress.

Also, we should know what causes our shortcomings. For example, we may have low self-esteem sometimes, so the root cause may be that we are not very confident in our appearance, so that we can make achievements in other aspects, so as to achieve balance</p>
